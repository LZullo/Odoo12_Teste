Development of a module that will add some functions to the Odoo 12 CRM module.

“There needs to be an improvement in the CRM module that allows sales consultants to register customer qualification information.”
 Each customer has the qualifying attributes:

- Number of units;
- Number of blocks;
- Number of residents;
- Type of concierge (own or outsourced)
- Concierge hours (24H or 12H)

This data is presented on the lead registration and editing screen. A report was also created that presents the customer's name and qualification data.
The sales consultant can freely change the customer's qualification records.

REQUIREMENTS

● Installation of Odoo 12
